# React

React is a framework for developing web frontends.
It only provides functionality corresponding to the view layer in three layer architecture.
The building blocks for a website inside of react are components, which represent one element on a website.
React offers class components through inheritance as well as functional components which are functions returning JSX.
JSX (Javascript XML) is the usual way inside of react projects to write HTML style code directly inside the javascript components.
